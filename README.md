# MarketLeague
St. Edward's University Senior Project repository for MarketLeague, a fantasy-football style approach to learning about the stock market. Users will be able to create a portfolio of stocks that act like trading cards, and users will be able to join leagues where they can trade stocks with other players.

## Running MarketLeague Locally
Requirements:
[Docker v27.2.0](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
```sh
./run_docker_dev.sh
```
This will run the `docker-compose.dev.yml` and will run the dev environments for the Angular Frontend and Gin Backend. Both will be updated as changes are made live.

### .env file
In order for MarketLeague to run correctly locally you will need to create a `.env` file with these properties:
```
POSTGRES_USER=user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
POSTGRES_DB=database
JWT_KEY=secretkey
```
Change `user`, `password`, and `database` to appropriate values.
