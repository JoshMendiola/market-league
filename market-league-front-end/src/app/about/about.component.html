            MarketLeague started with a simple idea: investing should be accessible and fun for everyone. As two passionate tech enthusiasts, we realized that the world of finance could be intimidating for many. We wanted to create a place where people could learn, grow, and experience the thrill of trading â€” all within a supportive and interactive community.
